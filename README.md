  <em>An approach to more ergonomic and healthy lifestyles with hazardous pose detection</em>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Motivation
One of the leading causes of worker injuries is ergonomics, where factory workers, construction workers, and even regular staff put themselves at risk when they move heavy equipment or materials. Since our team has experience in machine learning, we wanted to see if there was a way we could harness the power of computer vision and machine learning to detect these high risky poses and alert workers when they perform them so they can continue to live happy healthy lives.

### Goal
Build a model that is able to detect hazardous poses such as lifting items overhead, bending over, etc. in live time.

### Built With
* PoseNet model
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

### Challenges

One of the biggest challenges we faced was communication across time zones. Each of our team's members was located in a different time zone, which made communication difficult because at any given moment, half the team was sleeping. We were able to work around this by posting updates before we logged off so that everyone would know where we were at. Another issue we faced was simply starting. When looking at the challenge, we were given just a set of data and told to go forth and conquer. As a result we had to spend a lot of time deciding on what exactly we wanted to do and how when building our model. One of the first decisions we made was Python verses JavaScript. We went with JavaScript because we decided our ultimate goal was to have some way of logging into a website/server so you could remotely monitor a livestream from an outside location.
