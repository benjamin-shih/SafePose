## About The Project

###Prompt (from Hackathon):
Ergonomics are the leading cause of worker injuries, leaving millions of Americans with chronic issues and costing US businesses over $50B annually. The goal of warehouse risk/safety management is to keep workers safe and healthy, which includes ensuring that workers arenâ€™t putting themselves at risk by performing unsafe ergonomic activities.
Through the use of computer vision, we can help risk/safety managers to manage their workers by identifying high risk ergonomic activities, educating workers on the matter, and reducing the chance of injuries.

#Goal:
Build a model that is able to detect hazardous poses such as lifting items overhead, bending over, etc. in live time.
