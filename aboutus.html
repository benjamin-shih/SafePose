    <h1>Behind SafePose</h1>
    <h2>What exactly is SafePose?</h2>
    <p>SafePose uses PoseNet to identify unergonomic positions that are common in 
        the factory setting. We used machine learning to identify those poses and 
        mark them in a real time video feed. Here we have a demo where, given 
        permission to your computer's webcam, our model can identify the unergonomic
        positions that you take. We also have a sample of a factory security camera
        which shows our model working in a real life situation.
    </p>
    <h2>How was SafePose built?</h2>
    <p>We used PoseNet to identify different poses and then marked the keypoints in
        a pose to draw the skeleton of a person. Then we used machine learning 
        to detect potentially dangerous poses and log them.</p>
    <h2>How can SafePose be used in the real world?</h2>
    <p>We would like to deploy our model on the security cameras of a factory remotely
        so then you can ssh or somehow access the website remotely to monitor it. We 
        would also like to alert people when they perform an unergonomic pose so
        that they can quickly correct it.
